            <h1>Escape (the Pina Colada Song)</h1>
            <h3>by Rupert Holmes</h3>
        </header>

        <section class="song-text">
            <p>I was tired of my lady<br>
            We'd been together too long<br>
            Like a worn-out recording<br>
            of a favorite song<br>
            So while she lay there sleeping<br>
            I read the paper in bed<br>
            And in the personal columns<br>
            There was this letter I read:</p>

            <p>"If you like Pina Coladas<br>
            And getting caught in the rain,<br>
            If you're not into yoga<br>
            If you have half-a-brain,<br>
            If you like making love at midnights<br>
            In the dunes of the Cape<br>
            Then I'm the love that you've looked for:<br>
            Write to me and escape"</p>

            <p>I didn't think about my lady<br>
            I know that sounds kinda mean<br>
            But me and my old lady<br>
            Had fallen into the same old dull routine<br>
            So I wrote to the paper<br>
            Took out a personal ad<br>
            And though I'm nobody's poet<br>
            I thought it wasn't half bad</p>

            <p>Yes, I like piña coladas<br>
            And gettin' caught in the rain<br>
            I'm not much into health food<br>
            I am into champagne<br>
            I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon<br>
            And cut through all this red tape<br>
            At a bar called O'Malley's<br>
            Where we'll plan our escape</p>

            <p>So I waited with high hopes<br>
            And she walked in the place<br>
            I knew her smile in an instant<br>
            I knew the curve of her face<br>
            It was my own lovely lady<br>
            And she said, "Oh, it's you"<br>
            Then we laughed for a moment<br>
            And I said, "I never knew"</p>

            <p>"That you like piña coladas<br>
            And gettin' caught in the rain<br>
            And the feel of the ocean<br>
            And the taste of champagne<br>
            If you like making love at midnight<br>
            In the dunes on the cape<br>
            You're the lady I've looked for<br>
            Come with me and escape"</p>
